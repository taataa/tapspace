# Documentation Style Guide

This guide describes styling and aesthetics to be used in illustrations, charts, symbols, and logos. The aim of this guide is to keep the style coherent throughout the library, documentation, and example applications.

## Fonts

A web-safe font.

Helvetica
Size: 16pt

## Lines and borders

Match to font line width for consistency.

Use as small set of different border width and styles as conveniently possible.

## Dimensions

Prefer square images. They usually work well both on desktop and mobile.

## Colors

Background of an illustration should not be white nor transparent. Those do not work well with dark themes in GitHub and other publication sites. Light gray is a good choice for the background color.

## Charts

Prefer UML syntax but only when it is convenient. If a thing can be illustrated, then better to illustrate poorly than not at all.
